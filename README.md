# CZ2006-SE

Below is the course_index_object:
{
index_number: "39676",
details: [
{
type: "LEC/STUDIO",
group: "L1",
day: "WED",
time: {
full: "1130-1430",
start: "1130",
end: "1430",
duration: 3,
},
location: "NIE7-02-07",
flag: 0,
remarks: "",
},
],
}

Below is the time_table_cell_format:
{
title: "AAA08B",
startDate: new Date(2021, 3, 1, 9, 35),
endDate: new Date(2021, 3, 1, 11, 30),
id: 0,
type: "LEC/STUDIO",
group: "L1",
location: "NIE7-02-07",
remarks: "",
flag:0,
}

Please note that the above cell_format needs a startDate and endDate,
weekdays needs to be mapped into an exact date,
so we can set 2021-3-1 as Monday, 2021-3-2 as Tuesday and so on

can add more properties like flag(indicator for fixed index)
