<b>About Mycal</b><br/>
MyCal aims to assist the students to plan their courses, share their timetable, find common time slots between different timetables and even explore other courses before planning. It aims to simplify the convoluted process of finding the best-timetable for the user by bringing it to one place. The user can decide what courses (s)he wants to take by browsing through reviews in the discussion forum, and plan a timetable reflecting his/her needs for the semester.
